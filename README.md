[Build your Pokemon Team here!](https://kremmert.github.io/pokemon-team-builder/ "https://kremmert.github.io/pokemon-team-builder/")

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

My first attempt at building my own React app after learning about React and React Router. Data about each Pokemon is fetched from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ "https://pokeapi.co/"). Pokemon and their moves are managed using Redux. Styled using Bootstrap (The CSS still needs work).

Pick up to six Pokemon for your team! Each Pokemon can have four moves which can be selected by clicking on them after the data is fetched.
