This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

My first attempt at building a React app after learning about React and React Router. Data about each Pokemon is fetched from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ "https://pokeapi.co/"). Pokemon and their moves are managed using Redux. Styled using Bootstrap (The CSS still needs work).

Pokémon is © of Nintendo, 1995-2018
